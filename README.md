# Python-for-Data-Science
In this repository, I have added two jupyter notebooks based on Python 3.5 .  Mainly these notebooks have been created keeping in mind the fact that, any beginner in the field of data science who want to learn Python 3.5 can start with this. I have added syntax and use basic of data structures like - List, String, Tuple, Dictionary. Also the using of libraries like Numpy and Pandas have been added here. I want to add visualization tools like matplotlib/Seaborn in this repository in the coming days as well. 
A real time dataset i.e 'covid_19_data.csv' has been added here as well to to show the use pandas library.
